      <div class="name">Molly Greening</div>
      <div class="description">Molly Greening (cello) grew up in the north suburbs of Chicago and was initially drawn to the cello by a large purple dinosaur.  Enraptured while watching the instrument on the children's television show Barney and Friends, Molly began studying Western classical music at the Music Institute of Chicago when she was 5 years old.  Thanks to one of her music teachers (Clark Chaffee) who introduced her to blues improvisation, and the Suzuki method that taught her to play by ear, Molly's musical journey broadened beyond the Western classical scope. This led her to travel the world, pick up the er hu, study the Baul/Fakir singing traditions of West Bengal, learn Middle Eastern maqam, perform live music for belly dance and folk dance classes, and play in various rock/folk bands in the Midwest.  Currently she is a researcher and a PhD student at Loyola University Chicago studying ethics and theology.</div>
